# Haskell How To

This repository intends to be a wiki of sorts about Haskell (and functional
programming in general).

**NOTE**: The [Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/devhowto/haskell-how-to) is the
*main one where all the action happens and people can collaborate. The [Github
*repo](https://github.com/FernandoBasso/Haskell-How-To) is just a mirror.
