TypeScript offers all what is needed to transpile TypeScript source code to JavaScript.
What it doesn't do is to minify and optimize the resulting JavaScript for production.
For that, we need tools like Webpack, TSBuild (written in Go for faster builders), etc.

Other transpilers like Babel also work well with TypeScript.

== Type-checking JavaScript

Let's start with this piece of code:

[source,typescript]
----
const log = console.log.bind(console);

let num = 1;

if (Math.random() < 0.5)
  num = 'hello';

log(num);

function addVAT(price, vat = 0.2) {
  return price * (1 + vat);
}

addVAT(1000, '0.2');

addVAT(1000).toUpperCase();
----

Looks fine!

But add a `// @ts-check` _special comment_ (or directive?) an feel no shame if you start sobbing uncontrollably ðŸ˜­.

TODO: Is the line `// @ts-check` (and others, like `// @ts-expect-error` called a _special comment_? Maybe _directive_? Something else?

TypeScript will use type inference in all possible places to try to help.

Let's go again:

[source,javascript]
----
// <1>
let x = 1e3;

if (Math.random() < 0.5)
  x = "hello"; // <2>

log(x);

//              <3>
//                     <4>
function addVAT(price, vat = 0.2) {
  return price * (1 + vat);
}

//           <5>
addVAT(1000, "0.2");

//           <6>
addVAT(1000).toUpperCase();
----

<1> `x` is inferred to be of type `number`

<2> If `x` is of type `number`, we can't assign a `string` to it.

<3> Function parameters without an explicit type become `any`, and the type checker complains and warns about it.

<4> `vat` has a default assignment of `0.2`, which is of type `number`, so the type inference correctly guesses that `vat` is of type `number`.

<5> Cannot pass a value of type `string` where value of type `number` is expected.

<6> The return type of `addVAT()` is not `string` (guess what type it is!), so we cannot use `.toUpperCase()` with that value.

[TIP]
====
On point 6, we used addition and multiplication operators with the values.
Therefore TypeScript infers the return type of `addVAT()` to be `number`.
