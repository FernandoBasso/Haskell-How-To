# Algorithms and Data Structures in TypeScript

Some personal notes on my studies and research on Data Structures and Algorithms under the light of JavaScript and TypeScript.
JavaScript is what is actually run, so we want to understand and consider time and space complexity under JavaScript runtimes, and TypeScript gives us a chance to also think about types in a more concrete way.
