## Intro

The How to Design Programs Book (HtDP) is the book that has most changed the way I think about, see and do programming. I have previously gone through the How to Code: Systematic Program Design Course on EDX (part 1, 2 and 3, free, later updated and renamed to How To Code) which is based on the HtDP book.

Remember that TypeScript is JavaScript. Knowing TypeScript requires knowing JavaScript. All array and object methods, and all other APIs come from JavaScript. What we learn here is useful for JavaScript too.
