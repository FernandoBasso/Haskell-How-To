Intro
-----

Command line tools have NOT faded out into the past. They keep
evolving and being improved. A lot of GUI interfaces use command line
tools behind the scenes.

There exists a specification to standardize how command line utilities
should behave so that they work in a cross-plataform, interoperable way.

Besides reading the specs, also take a look at the sidebar about
reading and understanding man pages, info pages and help pages.

Single Unix Specification (SUS)
-------------------------------

- XBD: Base Definitions
- CCU: Shell and Utilities (Commands and Utilities)
- XSH: System Interfaces and XBD Headers

More info on the link `Open Group Website`_. There is also a question
about the `difference between SUS and Open Group`_.
