Intro
-----

Notes and solutions for the `Composable Functional JavaScript`_
free course on Egghead by the most excellent Brian Lonsdorf (a.k.a
DrBoolean).

Related material from the same author is the `Mostly Adequate Guide to
Functional Programming`_. This Dev How To project/site has a `section
with solutions and extra notes`_ on that (awesome and free)
book. Check it out!

A Note on the Wording Used
--------------------------

The explanations (my explantions and notes on the content of the
videos) at times use wording like “beginner-like approach”, or “this
implementation is too much procedural”, or “too much object-oriented”,
etc.

The intent is not to deride beginners [#]_ or to imply that other
programming paradigms are bad [#]_. The focus here is on functional
programming. We strive for a functional style as much as possible
since the goal is to learn and practice this specific programming
paradigm. So, when something does not conform to the principles of FP,
we occasionally make such comparisons and comments as a means to show
how much the given implementation is non-conformant, or how far away
it is to the functional paradigm.

Also, if beginners tend to do things in a certain way, that is OK. The
goal is to keep learning and improving. If the procedural, or the
object-oriented, or functional programming style have such and such
pros and cons, that is OK too [#]_. Again, the goal is to learn so we
can offer more educated opinions and make more informed decisions in
any given situation [#]_.

.. [#] I myself am a beginner in a lot of stuff, have always been, and
       will always be.

.. [#] I myself like to study and practice C, Shell Script, C++, Ruby,
       Java, etc., which are more procedural or object-oriented in style,
       among, of course, Haskell, Scheme, Lisp and similar which are
       either purely functional or are at least feel very comfortable and
       work well for a functional style.

.. [#] Similar things could be said about static-typing (at
       compile time) or dynamic typing (at runtime). Both have
       advantages and disadvantages (that is stating the obvious), but
       worth keeping in mind.

.. [#] I was amazed by John Carmack's humility when he said “now I
       *think* I get functional programming” and “I wanted to make a
       real program in Haskell so I could opine more concretely about
       Haskell and FP than if I had just having done some exercises
       from a book”. Then he implemented Wolfenstein 3D engine in
       Haskell. See `John Carmack's keynote at Quakecon 2013`_.
