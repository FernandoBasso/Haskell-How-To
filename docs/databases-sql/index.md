# Databases and SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
No mater which (relational) database vendor being used (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.), the language to work with the data and other aspects is the SQL language.
SQL does much more than just *query* data, though.

It is common to pronounce SQL as three letters S Q L (and not as the word “sequel”), which means we say “*an* SQL statement” rather than “*a* SQL (sequel) statement”.

Some notes, concepts, ideas, examples and guides on how to do work with:

- Data Definition Language (DDL).
- Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- Data Control Language (DCL). 
- A few other types of queries.

I use mostly PostgreSQL and MariaDB, so expect most examples to work on those.
