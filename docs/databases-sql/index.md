# Databases and SQL

Some notes, concepts, ideas, examples and guides on how to do work with:

- Data Definition Language (DDL).
- Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- Data Control Language (DCL). 
- A few other types of queries.

I use mostly PostgreSQL and MariaDB, so expect most examples to work on those.
