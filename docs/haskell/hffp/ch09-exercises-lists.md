# ch09 Exercises :: Lists

We can insert ⊥ (*bottom*) on Linux Gtk with `Ctrl+Shift+U` followed by `22a5`.
On Vim, in insert mode with `Ctrl+v u 22a5`.
On Emacs with `C-x u RET 22a5 RET`.

## Will it blow up?

Will the expressions return a value or ⊥ (*bottom*)?

```text
1. [x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]

2. take 1 $ [x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]

3. sum [1, undefined, 3]

4. length [1, 2, undefined]

5. length $ [1, 2, 3] ++ undefined

6. take 1 $ filter even [1, 2, 3, undefined]

7. take 1 $ filter even [1, 3, undefined]

8. take 1 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]

9. take 2 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]

10. take 3 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
```

### Exercise 01

```haskell
[x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]
```

The `undefined` from the second list will have to be evaluated as it is used as the exponent and this expression will return ⊥.

### Exercise 02

```haskell
take 1 $ [x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]
```

It will return the result of `1 ^ 2` and not ⊥.
This is because of `take 1` which will require the evaluation of the first pair only, not allowing evaluation to reach the `undefined`.

Because it is a list comprehension, it returns `1 ^ 2` (which is 1) inside a list, so the result is actually `[1]`.

### Exercise 03

```haskell
sum [1, undefined, 3]
```

Returns ⊥ because `sum` forces the values.

### Exercise 04

```haskell
length [1, 2, undefined]
```

Produces 3.
`length` only evals the spine, not forcing the values.

### Exercise 05

```haskell
length $ [1, 2, 3] ++ undefined
```

Produces ⊥.
Because of `++ undefined`, that `undefined` is part of the spine, and `length` needs to evaluate the spine.

NOTE: Of course, if we place that `undefined` in a value position (rather than in a spine position), then all is fine for `length`:

```text
λ> length $ [1, 2, 3] ++ [undefined]
4
```

### Exercise 06

```haskell
take 1 $ filter even [1, 2, 3, undefined]
```

Because of `take 1`, we’ll stop as soon as we find the even number `2` and we won’t reach `undefined`.
The result is `[2]`.

### Exercise 07

```haskell
take 1 $ filter even [1, 3, undefined]
```

Even though we have `take 1`, we don’t find an even number until we reach `undefined`, and `even` will force the value to check of its “evenness”, thus causing ⊥ to occur.

### Exercise 08

```haskell
take 1 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
```

An odd number is found before reaching `undefined`.
The result is `[1].`

### Exercise 09

```haskell
take 2 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
```

Two odd numbers are found just before reaching `undefined`.
The result is `[1, 3]`.

### Exercise 10

```haskell
take 3 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
```

Two odd numbers are found, but not the third before reaching `undefined`, causing ⊥ to occur.

## Is it in normal form?

Page 494.

- [Question about these in Haskell Discord](https://discord.com/channels/280033776820813825/1119736989005123805).

For each expression below, determine whether it’s in:

1. Normal form, which implies weak head normal form.
2. Weak head normal form only.
3. Neither.

Remember that an expression cannot be in normal form or weak head normal form if the outermost part of the expression isn’t a data constructor.
It can’t be in normal form if any part of the expression is unevaluated.

**NOTE**: The `_` symbol in the examples below mean a value or expression has not been evaluated.

### Exercise 01

```haskell
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

NF and WHNF.

NF because no expression or sub-expression is un-evaluated.
WHNF because it is evaluated to at least the first/outermost data constructor (and by definition, anything in NF is also in WHNF).

### Exercise 02

```haskell
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : _
```

WHNF.
Not all expressions have been evaluated due to the `_` symbol.

### Exercise 03

```haskell
enumFromTo 1 10
```

Neither because it is a function application to all possible arguments.

### Exercise 04

```haskell
length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Neither.
It is a function application.

### Exercise 05

```haskell
sum (enumFromTo 1 10)
```

Neither.
It is a function application, which results in a value, which is also applied to a function.

### Exercise 06

```haskell
['a'..'m'] ++ ['n'..'z']
```

Neither.
The outermost part is a function application of `++`.

### Exercise 07

```haskell
(_, 'b')
```

WHNF.
The outermost part is the data constructor `(,)` even though not all sub-expressions are fully evaluated.

---

To be clear here what's super important is recognizing that WHNF and NF are syntactic properties of expressions
And in particular it's very easy to find out if an expression is in WHNF
Neither are properties of the values denoted by those expressions

## More Bottoms

Page 504.


### Exercise 01

```haskell
take 1 $ map (+1) [undefined, 2, 3]
```

Will be ⊥ because the first element we try to take and force is `undefined`, which is *bottom*.

### Exercise 02

```haskell
take 1 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]
```

Yes,m it will return `[2]` from the evaluation of `(+ 1) 1`. We take 1 element before having to reach and try to force `undefined`.

### Exercise 03

```haskell
take 2 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]
```

No, it will be ⊥ because we try have to force two elements from the list, and the second one is `undefined`.

![Bottom Undefined Error](/staticassets/ch09-exercise-bottom-undefined-error.png)

Note the part in red. It was able to evaluate at least the first value, but reached *bottom* when trying the second one.

### Exercise 04

What does the following mystery function do?
What is its type?
Describe it (to yourself or a loved one) in standard English and
then test it out in the REPL to make sure you are correct.

```haskell
itIsMystery xs = map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
```

It returns a list of `Bool`.
`True` if the current element is a lowercase vowel, `False` otherwise.

It's type is `[Char] -> [Bool]`.

```text
λ> isMistery "hello"
[False,True,False,False,True]

λ> isMistery "abcde"
[True,False,False,False,True]
```

### Exercise 05

What will be the result of the following functions:

a. `map (^2) [1..10]`
b. `map minimum [[1..10], [10..20], [20..30]]` (n.b. `minimum` is not the same function ass the `min` function that we used before)
c. `map sum [[1..5], [1..5], [1..5]]`

#### a

Each element in the list will be raised to the second power:

```text
λ> map (^ 2) [1 .. 10]
[1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]
```

#### b

It will return a list with the smallest (minimum) value of each sub-list.

```text
λ> minimum [1 .. 10]
1
λ> minimum [10 .. 20]
10
λ> minimum [20 .. 30]
20
λ> map minimum [[1 .. 10], [10 .. 20], [20 .. 30]]
[1,10,20]
```

#### c

It will return a list with three elements which sums `[1 .. 5]` in each case.

```text
λ> map sum [[1 .. 5], [1 .. 5], [1 .. 5]]
[15,15,15]
```

### Exercise 06

Back in Chapter 7, you wrote a function called foldBool.
That function exists in a module known as Data.Bool and is called bool.
Write a function that does the same (or similar, if you wish) as the map if-then-else function you saw above but uses bool instead of the if-then-else syntax.
Your first step should be bringing the bool function into scope by typing import Data.
Bool at your REPL prompt.

This is the “map if-then-else function we saw above”:

```text
λ> map (\x -> if x == 3 then (- x) else x) [1 .. 10]
[1,2,-3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

First, here’s how `bool` from `Data.Bool` works:

![Prelude Data.Bool as of 2023](/staticassets/prelulde-data-bool-2023.png)

It takes an argument of type $a$ and another argument of type $a$ and a `Bool`.
If the `Bool` is `False`, return the first argument; else return the second argument.

```text
λ> import Data.Bool (bool)
λ> :type bool
bool :: a -> a -> Bool -> a
λ> bool "Lara" "Croft" False
"Lara"
λ> bool "Lara" "Croft" True
"Croft"

λ> if not False then "Lara" else "Croft"
"Lara"
λ> if False then "Lara" else "Croft"
"Croft"
```

So, the solution:

```text
import Data.Bool (bool)

λ> map (\n -> bool n (- n) (n == 3)) [1 .. 5]
[1,2,-3,4,5]
```

`n` is the current number.
If `n == 3` is `False`, simply return `n`.
But if `n == 3` is `True`, then negate `n`.

## Exercises: Filtering

Page 335.

### Exercise 1

How might we write a filter function that would give us all the multiples of 3 out of a list from 1 to 30?

A multiple of 3 is a number whose remainder of it by 3 is 0.

One approach is to make a tiny helper function to check if a number is a multiple of three and then use it in the “main” function.

```haskell
isMultipleOf3 :: Int -> Bool
isMultipleOf3 n = rem n 3 == 0
```

```text
λ> filter isMultipleOf3 [1 .. 30]
[3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30]
```

### Exercise 2

Recalling what we learned about function composition, how
could we compose the above function with the length function
to tell us how many multiples of 3 there are between 1 and 30?

```haskell
isMultipleOf3 :: Int -> Bool
isMultipleOf3 n = rem n 3 == 0

countMultiplesOf3 :: [Int] -> Int
countMultiplesOf3 = length . filter isMultipleOf3
```

Of course, we’d rather do it more abstract and reusable:

```haskell
--
-- Checks whether y is a multiple of x.
--
isMultipleOf :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool
isMultipleOf x y = rem y x == 0

countMultiplesOf :: Integer -> [Integer] -> Int
countMultiplesOf n = length . filter (isMultipleOf n)
```

```text
λ> countMultiplesOf 3 [1 .. 30]
10
λ> countMultiplesOf 5 [1 .. 30]
6
λ> countMultiplesOf 10 [1 .. 30]
3
```

### Exercise 3

Next, we’re going to work on removing all articles (“the,” “a,” and “an”) from sentences.
You want to get to something that works like this:

```text
λ> myFilter "the brown dog was a goof"
["brown","dog","was","goof"]
```

Let’s assume these three string examples:

```haskell
snake :: [Char]
snake = "there a snake in here"

fruit :: [Char]
fuit = "an apple is a fruit"

jedi :: [Char]
jedi = "may the force be with you"
```

#### Solution 1

One approach is maybe create a tiny `isArticle` function that is then used in the “main” function:

```haskell
--
-- ASSUME: The input is all in lower case.
--
isArticle :: [Char] -> Bool
isArticle word = word == "a" || word == "an" || wrod "the"

--
-- ASSUME: The input is all in lowercase.
--
dropArticles :: [Char] -> [[Char]]
dropArticles str = filter (not . isArticle) (words str)
```

Note the `not . isArticle` composition.

```text
λ> dropArticles snake
["there","snake","here"]

λ> dropArticles fruit
["apple","is","fruit"]

λ> dropArticles jedi
["may","force","be","with","you"]
```

```{hint}
The type `[Char] -> [[Char]` is the same as `String -> [String]`.
```

#### Solution 2

Another approach is to do it all at once in the same function:

```haskell
dropArticles :: [Char] -> [[Char]]
dropArticles = filter (\s -> not . elem s $ ["a", "an", "the"]) . words
```

First split the string into individual words and then drop it if it is not "a", "an" or "the".
Function composition and point-free style were used for this solution
and also the application operator `$`.

And instead of `not . elem`, let's remember that `notElem` exists in
Prelude:

```haskell
dropArticles :: [Char] -> [[Char]]
dropArticles = filter (\s -> notElem s $ ["a", "an", "the"]) . words
```

## Zipping exercises

Page 337.

### Exercise 1

Write your own version of zip, and ensure it behaves the same as the original:

```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
zip = undefined
```

#### Solution 1

```haskell
myZip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
myZip [] _              = []
myZip _ []              = []
myZip (x : xs) (y : ys) = (:) (x, y) $ myZip xs ys
```

Pattern matching and the cons operator.
The application operator `$` is used too, and it is possible because the cons operator `:` was placed in prefix position.

We could also use parentheses instead of `$`:

```haskell
... = (:) (x, y) (myZip xs ys)
```

And use the cons in infix position:

```haskell
... = (x, y) : (myZip xs ys)
```

#### Solution 2

Using the _go_ function pattern, which allows us to use tail call recursion:

```haskell
myZip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
myZip xs ys = go xs ys []
  where
    go :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)] -> [(a, b)]
    go [] _ acc                = acc
    go _ [] acc                = acc
    go (x : lox) (y : loy) acc = go lox loy (acc ++ [(x, y)])
```

Note how an accumulator was introduced so the _consing_ of the list happens at the last position, thus enabling TCO.

Also, we do `acc ++ [(x, y)]` rather than `[(x, y)] ++ acc`, because we want to append to the accumulator, not prepend to it.

### Exercise 2

Do what you did for `zip` but now for `zipWith`:

```haskell
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith = undefined
```

#### Solution 1

```haskell
myZipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [] a -> [] b -> [] c
myZipWith _ [] _              = []
myZipWith _ _ []              = []
myZipWith f (x : xs) (y : ys) = [f x y] ++ (myZipWith f xs ys)
```

Because we are NOT doing tail call in this solution, we do `[f x y] ++ “the rest of the recursion”`.

#### Solution 2

Using the _go_ function pattern and tail call optimization.

```haskell
myZipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
myZipWith f xs ys = go f xs ys []
  where
    go :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [c]
    go _ [] _ acc                 = acc
    go _ _ [] acc                 = acc
    go fn (x : lox) (y : loy) acc = go fn lox loy (acc ++ [(fn x y)])
```

Because we are doing TCO, we do `acc ++ [(fn x y)]`.
The accumulator always has the latest computation thus far.
With TCO, we are not just storing expressions that will be evaluated later, in the unwinding phase of the execution.

So, if we do `(f x) ++ rest` or `acc ++ (f x)` depends on the type of recursion we are doing.

## Exercise 3

Rewrite your `zip` in terms of the `zipWith` you wrote.

### Solution 1

Well, `zip` must create a tuple, and to create a tuple we use the tuple constructor `(,)`.
`zipWith` takes a function.
We can simply partially apply `myZipWith` to `(,)` and we are done!

```haskell
myZip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
myZip = myZipWith (,)
```

```text
λ> myZip [1, 2] "ab"
[(1,'a'),(2,'b')]
```

We also made `myZip` point-free.

## Chapter exercises

Page 338.

NOTE: We'll need to import functions from `Data.Char`.

### Data.Char

#### Exercise 1

Query the types of isUpper and toUpper.

##### Solution

```text
λ> import Data.Char (isUpper, isLower)

λ> :type isUpper
isUpper :: Char -> Bool

λ> :type isLower
isLower :: Char -> Bool
```

#### Exercise 2

Given the following behaviors, which would we use to write a function that filters all the uppercase letters out of a String?

```text
λ> isUpper 'J'
True
λ> toUpper 'j'
'J'
```

Write that function such that, given the input `"HbEfLrLxO"`, your function will return `"HELLO"`.

##### Which function?

If we want to filter all uppercase letters, it means we want to ignore the lowercase letters.
We could use `not . isLower`, but simpler yet is to simply use `isUpper`.

Also, we don't to transform a letter to uppercase, but just check if it is uppercase.
Thus, we use `isUpper` instead of `toUpper`.

##### Solution 1

Idiomatic approach making use of stdfn `filter` and simply partially applying it to `isUpper`.
We also use point-free style.

```haskell
import Data.Char (isUpper)

onlyUppers :: [Char] -> [Char]
onlyUppers = filter isUpper

--
-- λ> onlyUppers "HbEfLrLxO"
-- "HELLO"
--
```

##### Solution 2

Pattern matching, _go_ function approach, and manually accumulating the uppercase letters.

```haskell
import Data.Char (isUpper)

onlyUppers :: [Char] -> [Char]
onlyUppers str = go str []
  where
    go :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]
    go [] loc       = loc
    go (c : cs) loc =
      if isUpper c
      then go cs (c : loc)
      else go cs loc
```

#### Exercise 3

Write a function that will capitalize the first letter of a string and return the entire string.
For example, if given the argument "julie", it will return "Julie".

##### Solution

Pattern match on the first char and the rest of the string uppercase the first char and cons it to the rest of the unmodified string.

```haskell
import Data.Char (toUpper)

--
-- ASSUME: The input has length >= 1.
--
capitalize :: [Char] -> [Char]
capitalize [] = ""
capitalize (c : cs) = toUpper c : cs
--
-- λ> capitalize "yoda"
-- "Yoda"
--
-- λ> capitalize "ahsoka tano"
-- "Ahsoka tano"
--
```

#### Exercise 4

Now make a new version of that function that is recursive, such that if you give it the input "woot", it will holler back at you "WOOT".
The type signature won’t change, but you will want to add a base case.

##### Solution 1

Pattern matching and the cons operator `:`.

```haskell
import Data.Char (toUpper)

capitalizeAll :: [Char] -> [Char]
capitalizeAll []       =      ""
capitalizeAll (c : cs) =  toUpper c : capitalizeAll cs
--
-- λ> capitalizeAll "https"
-- "HTTPS"
--
```

##### Solution 2

Point-free style using `foldr` (not yet learned in the book at this point) and function composition.

```haskell
import Data.Char (toUpper)

capitalizeAll :: [Char] -> [Char]
capitalizeAll = foldr ((:) . toUpper) ""
```

`:` cons is composed with `toUpper`.
Each character is then uppercased and consed onto the accumulator, producing the final all-uppercase string result.

#### Exercise 5

To do the final exercise in this section, we’ll need another standard function for lists called head.
Query the type of head, and experiment with it to see what it does.
Now write a function that will capitalize the first letter of a String and return only that letter as the result.

```text
λ> :type head
head :: [a] -> a
```

##### Solution 1

The `$` ‘infixr 0’ function application operator causes `head` to be applied to `str` first.
That result is then the argument to toUpper.

```haskell
capitalizeFirst :: [Char] -> Char
capitalizeFirst str = toUpper $ head str
```

#### Exercise 6

##### Solution 1

Point-free, function composition.
`head` returns the first char of the string which `toUpper` is then applied.

```haskell
capitalizeFirst :: [Char] -> Char
capitalizeFirst = toUpper . head
--
-- λ> capitalizeFirst "haskell"
-- 'H'
--
```

### Ciphers

Basically, do a rightwards Caesar shift.

Let's consider lowercase-only English alphabet letters.

#### Solution 1 (baby steps 😅)

We'll go with an approach where we map each letter from 'a' to 'z' to ints from 0 to 25.
So 'a' is 0 and 'z' is 25.

Recall that 'a' is 97 in both ASCII and UTF-8.
Let's name our 97 as `a`:

```haskell
a :: Int
a = 97
```

The English alphabet has 26 letters:

```text
λ> length ['a' .. 'z']
26
```

That means we need to “wrap around” at 26.
That will be one of our parameters to the `mod` function:

```text
λ> mod 0 26
0

λ> mod 1 26
1

λ> mod 25 26
25

λ> mod 26 26
0

λ> mod 27 26
1
```

Consider 'z', which is 25 in our 0 to 25 mapping.
If we want to shift 'z' rightwards by 1 position, we'll do $25 + 1 = 26$, and `mod 26 26` is 0, which is the position for 'a'.
Then, $0 + 97 = 97$, and `ord 97` is 'a'. $1 + 97 = 98$, and `ord 98` is 'b'.
By adding 97 to our ints, we can compute the int value of each one of the letters from 0 to 25.

```{info}
I learned about this ideas of addign or subtracting from a char in the book The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (also informally known as the KR C book)
```

Play with those ideas in GHCi's REPL to get a better feeling for it.

```haskell
module Cipher1 where

import Data.Char (chr, ord)

--
-- The int value of 'a' in ASCII and UTF-8 is 97.
--
a :: Int
a = 97

--
-- Because the English alphabet contains 26 letters, this is the
-- number we need to “wrap around” when shifting char positions.
--
wrp :: Int
wrp = 26

--
-- Translates the zero-based position of a character `c` in the
-- lowercase English alphabet into its corresponding 0 to 25 numeric
-- mapping.
--
-- Examples:
-- • ‘a’ → 0
-- • ‘z’ → 25
--
toPos :: Char -> Int
toPos c = ord c - a

--
-- Translates the zero-based position `i` into its corresponding
-- lowercase letter in the English Alphabet.
--
-- Examples:
-- •  0 → ‘a’
-- • 25 → ‘z’
--
toChr :: Int -> Char
toChr i = chr $ i + a

--
-- Right-shifts c by n positions.
--
-- Examples:
--
-- • move 1 'a' → 'b'
-- • move 3 'a' → 'd'
-- • move 1 'z' → 'a'
-- • move 3 'z' → 'c'
--
move :: Int -> Char -> Char
move n c = toChr $ mod (toPos c + n) wrp

--
-- Applies the Caesar to `chrs` by shifting each letter `n` positions
-- to the right.
--
-- ASSUME: Lowercase-only English alphabet letters.
--
caesar :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
caesar n chrs = map (move n) chrs
```

Then, on a GHCi session, we can test try it:

```text
λ> caesar 3 "xyz"
"abc"

λ> caesar 1 "abc"
"bcd"

λ> caesar 3 "abc"
"def"

λ> caesar 1 "xyz"
"yza"

λ> caesar 3 "xyz"
"abc"
```

We could make `caesar` take only the `n` param and leave the `chrs` argument to `map` point free:

```haskell
caesar :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
caesar n = map (move n)
```

Other changes like partially applying `move` to `n` would also be possible, but this is good enough.

#### Solution 2

Currently, `move` can only shift chars to the right.
How can we make `move` able to shift characters to the right _and_ to the left as well?
If we find a solution for this, we would also be able to do the `unCaesar` function asked in the book.

This is the current implementation:

```haskell
--
-- Right-shifts c by n positions.
--
-- Examples:
--
-- • move 1 'a' → 'b'
-- • move 3 'a' → 'd'
-- • move 1 'z' → 'a'
-- • move 3 'z' → 'c'
--
move :: Int -> Char -> Char
move n c = toChr $ mod (toPos c + n) wrp
```

Hmm... We are always using `+` to _add_ (shift to the right).
If we can improve `move` so that it takes the function `+` or `-` as parameter, then it would be able to shift chars left and right.

Let's try this:

```haskell
--
-- Shifts `c` by `n` positions left or right according to `f`.
--
-- Examples:
--
-- • move (+) 3 'z' → 'c'
-- • move (-) 3 'a' → 'x'
--
move :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> Char -> Char
move f n c = toChr $ mod (f (toPos c) n) wrp
```

And a in GHCi:

```text
λ> move (+) 1 'z'
'a'

λ> move (-) 1 'a'
'z
```

And let's also update `caesar`:

```haskell
--
-- Applies the Caesar to `chrs` by shifting each letter `n` positions
-- to the right or left according to `f`.
--
-- ASSUME: Lowercase-only English alphabet letters.
--
caesar :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
caesar f n = map (move f n)
```

Which then works like this:

```text
λ> caesar (+) 3 "xyz"
"abc"

λ> caesar (-) 3 "abc"
"xyz"
```

That is cool and all and all this FP trickery!
Nice to practice and learn, but it so happens that our original version was already taking are of left and right shifts.

#### Solution 3

Our original `move` function was already able to take care of _both left and right shifting:

```haskell

move :: Int -> Char -> Char
move n c = toChr $ mod (toPos c + n) wrp
```

Even though it uses `(+)` exclusively, if we pass it a negative `n`, it actually subtracts `n` from the result of `toPos c`.
Isn't math a lot of fun‽

```text
λ> 1 + (-3)
-2

λ> toPos 'a'
0

λ> toPos 'a' + (-3)
-3

λ> move (-1) 'z'
'y'

λ> move (-1) 'a'
'z'
```

So, let's just update our doc comments and the examples and call it a day!

```haskell
module Cipher3 where

import Data.Char (chr, ord)

--
-- The int value of 'a' in ASCII and UTF-8 is 97.
--
a :: Int
a = 97

--
-- Because the English alphabet contains 26 letters, this is the
-- number we need to “wrap around” when shifting char positions.
--
wrp :: Int
wrp = 26

--
-- Translates the zero-based position of a character `c` in the
-- lowercase English alphabet into its corresponding 0 to 25 numeric
-- mapping.
--
-- Examples:
-- • ‘a’ → 0
-- • ‘z’ → 25
--
toPos :: Char -> Int
toPos c = ord c - a

--
-- Translates the zero-based position `i` into its corresponding
-- lowercase letter in the English Alphabet.
--
-- Examples:
-- •  0 → ‘a’
-- • 25 → ‘z’
--
toChr :: Int -> Char
toChr i = chr $ i + a

--
-- Shifts `c` by `n` positions left or right according to `n` being
-- positive or negative!
--
-- Examples:
--
-- • move 1 'a' → 'b'
-- • move (-1) 'a' → 'z'
-- • move 3 'z' → 'c'
-- • move (-3) 'a' → 'x'
--
move :: Int -> Char -> Char
move n c = toChr $ mod (toPos c + n) wrp

--
-- Applies the Caesar to `chrs` by shifting each letter `n` positions
-- to the right if `n` is positive; to the left if `n` is negative.
--
-- ASSUME: Lowercase-only English alphabet letters.
--
caesar :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
caesar n = map (move n)
--
-- λ> caesar 3 "abc"
-- "def"
--
-- λ> caesar 3 "xyz"
-- "abc"
--
-- λ> caesar (-3) "abc"
-- "xyz"
--
-- λ> caesar (-3) "xyz"
-- "uvw"
--
```

#### Solution 4

So our `caesar` implementation is able to encrypt and decrypt messages just by virtue of the `n` param being positive or negative.
But the book mentions we should create both `caesar` and the `unCaesar` functions.

```haskell
caesar :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
caesar n = map (move $ abs n)

unCaesar :: Int -> [Char] -> [Char]
unCaesar n = map (move (negate . abs $ n))
```

We use `abs` and `negate` to prevent `caesar` and `unCaesar` to work incorrectly in case users pass a negative int, as these two functions will now each work to shift chars to the right or left directions respectively.

This fourth solution is not much better than the third one where `caesar` alone was able to encrypt and decrypt messages solely based on `n` being positive or negative.

### Writing your own standard functions

#### myAnd

```haskell
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd []       = True
myAnd (b : bs) = case b of
  False -> False
  _     -> myAnd bs
```

Linter suggests rewriting using _if then else_ syntax:

```haskell
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd [] = True
myAnd (b : bs) = if b then myAnd bs else False
```

Which in turn complains _if_ is redundant, and `&&` should be used instead:

```haskell
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd []       = True
myAnd (b : bs) = b && myAnd bs
```

And using `foldr` (which we didn't learn yet in the book):

```haskell
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd bs = foldr (&&) True bs
```

And it is possible to make it point-free:

```haskell
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd = foldr (&&) True
```

#### myOr

We could do as with `myAnd` and try different implementations, but let's stick to this one:

```haskell
myOr :: [Bool] -> Bool
myOr []       = False
myOr (b : bs) = b || myOr bs
```

Note that for `myAnd`, the base case for the empty list is `True`, whereas for `myOr`, the base case for the empty list is `False`.

#### myAny

```haskell
myAny :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
myAny _ []       = False
myAny f (x : xs) = f x || myAny f xs
--
-- λ> myAny even [1, 3, 4, 5]
-- True
--
```

#### myElem

First the recursive approach:

```haskell
myElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
myElem _ []       = False
myElem e (x : xs) = (==) e x || myElem e xs
```

Then using `myAny`:

```haskell
myElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
myElem e = myAny (e ==)
--
-- λ> myElem 3 [1, 5, 9]
-- False
--
-- λ> myElem 3 [1, 5, 3, 9]
-- True
--
```

Point-free on the list element (we don't do `myElem e xs`, but `myElem e`).
And we do _sectioning_ and _partial application_ of `==` to `e`.

#### myReverse

Get `x` from the head of the list, and concatenate it to the end :)
We put it (the `x`) inside brackets to make a list out of it, as `++` concatenates lists (both operands must be lists).

```haskell
myRev :: [a] -> [a]
myRev []       = []
myRev (x : xs) = myRev xs ++ [x]
--
-- λ> myRev "xyz"
-- "zyx"
--
```

#### squish

```haskell
squish :: [[a]] -> [a]
squish []         = []
squish (xs : xss) = xs ++ squish xss
-- 
-- λ> squish [[1], [2], [3]]
-- [1,2,3]
-- 
```

Or using `foldr` and point-free style (not specifying the `xss` param):

```haskell
squish :: [[a]] -> [a]
squish = foldr (++) []
```

#### squishMap

NOTE: `squishMap` is just like `concatMap` from `Data.Foldable`.

```haskell
squishMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
squishMap _ []         = []
squishMap f (xs : xss) = f xs ++ squishMap f xss
--
-- λ> squishMap (\x -> [1, x, 3]) [2]
-- [1,2,3]
--
-- λ> squishMap (\x -> [x + 1]) [1, 2, 3]
-- [2,3,4]
--
```

Or reusing `squish` and function composition with `map`.
Point-free as the list parameter is not explicitly specified.

```haskell
squishMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
squishMap f = squish . map f
```

To try to understand it better, look at this:

```text
λ> map (\n -> [1, n, 3]) [2]
[[1,2,3]]
```

`map` itself returns a list, and the lambda is returning a list of its own, thus the result the list returned by the lambda contained _inside_ of the list returned by `map`.
Then `squish` flattens it to a single-level list.

#### squishAgain

```haskell
squishAgain :: [[a]] -> [a]
squishAgain = squishMap id
--
-- λ> squishAgain [[1], [2], [3]]
-- [1,2,3]
--
```

`id` simply returns the argument given to it, and our `squishAgain` is supposed to simply flatten a list of lists.
Because we are asked to use `squishMap` which requires a function as its first arg, but we don't want to transform each inner list in any way, we then simply give it `id`.

#### myMaximumBy

```text
λ> import Data.Foldable (maximumBy)

λ> :type maximumBy 
maximumBy :: Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a

λ> maximumBy compare []
*** Exception: maximumBy: empty structure
```

Note that `maximumBy` is not defined for empty lists.

For now, we can consider `Folable t` to be a _list of t_ `[t]`.

##### Solution 1

```haskell
myMaximumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
myMaximumBy f xs = go f (tail xs) (head xs)
  where
    go :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a -> a
    go _  []        winner = winner
    go fn (h : lst) winner =
      case fn h winner of
        GT -> go fn lst h
        _  -> go fn lst winner
```

Using the _go_ function pattern, start by considering the `head` of the list to be the _maximum so far_, keep `go` recurring with either the current _maximum so far_ or the new _maximum_ value.

##### Solution 2

NOTE: There is a [Discord thread on this solution](https://discord.com/channels/280033776820813825/505367988166197268/1135899035044151366).

```haskell
myMaximumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
myMaximumBy _ [x]      = x
myMaximumBy f (x : xs) =
  case f x g of
    LT -> g
    _  -> x
  where g = myMaximumBy f xs
```

`g` is the result of applying `myMaximumBy` to `f` and `xs`, but here `xs` is actually the tail of the list (because of `(x : xs)` pattern matching).

It will build expressions up to a point where the list is composed of a single element, when it pattern matches on `_ [x]`.
From there, it can finally “unwind” and evaluate the built expressions.
And because of those things, it will actually compare backwards.

Let's rename `myMaximumBy` to `mmb`, inline `g`, rename `x` and `xs` to `h` and `rest` respectively, make `f` an alias to `compare`, and try to visualize what is going on.

```haskell
mmb :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
mmb _ [n]        = n
mmb f (h : rest) =
  case f h (mmb f rest) of
    LT -> mmb f rest
    _  -> h
```

Apply `mmb` to `f` and `[3, 2, 4, 1]`.

`h` is 3 and `rest` is `[2, 4, 1]`.

```text
mmb f (2 : [3, 4, 1])
  case f 2 (mmb f [3, 4, 1]) of
    LT -> mmb f [3, 4, 1]
    _  -> 2
```

We yet don't know what is the result of `case f 3 (mmb f [2, 4, 1]) of`, so we have to evaluate it.

Our new `h` is 3 and the new `rest` is `[4, 1]`.

```text
mmb f (2 : [4, 1])
  case f 2 (mmb f [4, 1]) of
    LT -> mmb f [4, 1]
    _  -> 2
```

We yet don't know what is the result of `case f 2 (mmb f [4, 1]) of`, so we have to evaluate it.

Our new `h` is 4 and the new `rest` is `[1]`.

```text
mmb f (4 : [1])
  case f 4 (mmb f [1]) of
    LT -> mmb f [1]
    _  -> 4
```

At this point, we call `mmb f [1]`, which will finally cause `_ [n]` pattern to match, and return 1.
We finally have two numeric values to compare in `case of` and start “unwinding” the expressions.

The `case ... of` will now compare 4 and 1, and 4 is the winner.
Then 4 and 2, an 4 is still the winner.
Then 4 and 3, and 4 is still the winner.

What about we try with `[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]`?
Remember our `case ... of`:

```haskell
case f h (mmb f rest) of
  LT -> mmb f rest
  _  -> h
```

Then:

```text
case f 1 (mmb f [5, 3, 4, 2])

  case f 5 (mmb f [3, 4, 2])

    case f 3 (mmb f [4, 2])

      case f 4 (mmb f [2])

      case f 4 2 ⇒ 4

    case f 3 4 ⇒ 4

  case f 5 4 ⇒ 5

case f 1 5 ⇒ 5
```
