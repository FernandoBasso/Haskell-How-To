values and types
----------------

.. container:: qanda

   .. container:: question

      Values have types. In Haskell, we cannot have an *untyped* value.  Types
      are like groups that contains values that belong to that group.

      Enumerate a few values that would belong to the type (a.k.a *datatype*)
      ``Char`` and a few that would belong to the type ``Word``.  Type the question
      here.

   .. container:: answer

      * ``Char``:

        * ``'a'``
        * ``'9'``
        * ``' '``

      * ``Word``

        * ``0``
        * ``42``

      It is important to note that ``Word`` includes only natural numbers,
      from zero onward.
