Ruby is a delightful programming language designed for programmer happiness üíñ.

Yukihiro Matsumoto once presented [How Emacs Changed My Life (PDF)](./Yukihiro-Matsumoto-How-Emacs-Changed-My-Life.pdf) which goes into how [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [emacs-lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/) influenced Matz and the design of the Ruby programming language.
Unfortunately, it seems there is not video recording of it.
[Here's the Slideshare link](https://www.slideshare.net/yukihiro_matz/how-emacs-changed-my-life) for the presentation.

## Ruby Concepts and Ideas

- The name of the language is spelled *Ruby* (not RUBY or ruby) because it is a proper noun (therefore, the first letter is capitalized). `ruby` is the name of the program we use to run Ruby programs, like `ruby -w fib.rb`.
- A *mix-in* (also spelled *mix in*) is the including of a module inside a class. We say things like ‚ÄúThe Enumerable mix-in module provides...‚Äù. See [Ruby doc on modules](https://ruby-doc.com/core/doc/syntax/modules_and_classes_rdoc.html).
