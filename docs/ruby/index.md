Ruby is a delightful programming language designed for programmer happiness ðŸ’–.

Yukihiro Matsumoto once presented [How Emacs Changed My Life (PDF)](./Yukihiro-Matsumoto-How-Emacs-Changed-My-Life.pdf) which goes into how [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [emacs-lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/) influenced Matz and the design of the Ruby programming language.
Unfortunately, it seems there is not video recording of it.
[Here's the Slideshare link](https://www.slideshare.net/yukihiro_matz/how-emacs-changed-my-life) for the presentation.
