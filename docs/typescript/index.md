# TypeScript

Why do we need types in JavaScript anyway?

First of all, JavaScript already has types. Since its inception in Netscape. Just that it is a dynamically-, weakly-typed (not statically- and strongly-typed). What it doesn't have is type annotations.

The fact that it has types and people ignore them is the single most cause of bugs in JavaScript programs and applications.

Types help us make sure we use our code in the way it is intended to be, define a contract, and also immensely help us to convey intent, which means they also serve as documentation, making the code more self-documenting.
